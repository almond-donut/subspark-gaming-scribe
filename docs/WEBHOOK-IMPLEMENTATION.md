# VODSCRIBE Webhook System Implementation

This document provides an overview of the webhook system implementation for the VODSCRIBE web application.

## Components Implemented

1. **Payment Webhook Handlers**
   - Created handlers for PayPal and Ko-fi payment notifications
   - Implemented verification of webhook authenticity using signatures/tokens
   - Added logic to update subscriptions and payments in the database

2. **Webhook Server**
   - Set up Express.js server to handle webhook requests
   - Configured middleware for processing request bodies
   - Added health check and debug endpoints for monitoring

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Created a webhook testing utility to simulate events locally
   - Added documentation for using ngrok for external testing

4. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Created detailed deployment guide for production environments
   - Added instructions for setting up with NGINX and PM2
   - Documented serverless deployment options

## Configuration

The webhook system uses environment variables for configuration:
- `PORT`: The port number for the webhook server (default: 3001)
- `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Secret from PayPal Developer Dashboard
- `KOFI_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`: Verification token from Ko-fi settings

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Add structured logging with Winston or similar
   - Implement Prometheus metrics for system health

2. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Add a queue system for failed webhook processing
   - Implement automatic retries for database operations

3. **Administrative Interface**
   - Create a UI for viewing webhook event history
   - Add tools for manually triggering subscription updates

4. **Event Normalization**
   - Standardize events from different payment providers
   - Create a unified payment event model

## Testing

The webhook system can be tested using:

```sh
# Start the webhook server
npm run dev:server

# In another terminal, run the webhook testing tool
npm run test:webhooks
```

## Dependencies

- express: Web server framework
- cors: Cross-origin resource sharing
- body-parser: Request body parsing
- crypto: For signature verification
- dotenv: Environment variable management

## Scripts

- `npm run dev:server`: Start the webhook server in development mode
- `npm run server`: Start the webhook server in production mode
- `npm run test:webhooks`: Run the webhook testing utility
- `./scripts/setup-webhooks.ps1`: PowerShell script to set up webhook dependencies
